An Employee Management System (EMS) project aims to develop a comprehensive software solution that automates and streamlines various aspects of employee administration within an organization. 
This system will encompass features such as employee data management, attendance tracking, leave application and approval, payroll processing, and performance evaluation. 
By centralizing these functions into a cohesive digital platform, the EMS enhances operational efficiency, data accuracy, and decision-making while promoting better employee engagement and resource allocation.
